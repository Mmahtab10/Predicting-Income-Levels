# Predicting Income Level Based on Census Data

## Project Requirements
For this project, we propose a problem for a made-up client using machine learning techniques. We will compare at least three machine learning models as potential solutions for this problem.

## Instructions To Run
To run this project on Google Colab, simply select the Runtime button and choose Run all. Alternatively, you can set up a local environment, install the necessary packages, and run it locally.

## Background
The "Adult" dataset, also known as the "census income" dataset, includes demographic and employment information from the U.S. census. It aims to predict whether an individual earns more than $50,000 annually, making it a good candidate for practicing binary classification techniques.

## Motivation
Using the Adult dataset addresses a real-world problem beneficial for socioeconomic studies, policymaking, and targeted marketing. It also provides a rich dataset requiring comprehensive machine learning practices, offering insights into income determinants for young adults entering the workforce.

## Project Approach
Following our conversation with Dr. Dawson, the project follows a structure similar to our assignments. Key steps include:
- Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling features, and feature engineering.
- Model comparison: Logistic Regression, KNeighborsClassifier, and SVC, selected for their effectiveness in binary classification.
- Experimentation: Creating pipelines for each model to streamline experimentation with different configurations and hyperparameters.
- Performance evaluation: Using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- Visualization: Exploring feature distributions, relationships, and feature importance.

## Data Source
The Adult dataset is publicly available and can be accessed from repositories like the UCI Machine Learning Repository or through this [link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/2/adult).

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the end-to-end application of machine learning to a practical problem. It highlights the importance of meticulous data preprocessing, strategic model selection, and insightful performance analysis. Our goal is to predict income levels from census data with high cross-validation scores, providing valuable insights into the factors influencing earning potential.
